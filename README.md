# Sorting and Searching Algorithms in C

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

### ðŸ”¹ Sorting Algorithms
1. **Bubble Sort** â€“ Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
2. **Selection Sort** â€“ Selects the smallest element and places it in order.
3. **Insertion Sort** â€“ Builds the sorted list one item at a time.
4. **Merge Sort** â€“ A divide-and-conquer algorithm that merges sorted halves.
5. **Quick Sort** â€“ Uses partitioning and recursion for fast sorting.

### ðŸ”¹ Searching Algorithms
1. **Linear Search** â€“ Searches an element sequentially in an array.
2. **Binary Search** â€“ Efficient searching in a sorted array using divide and conquer.
